[00:00.25] Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)
[00:02.88] On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)
[00:05.63] New girl moved on the block (on the block)
[00:08.36] She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock)
[00:11.25] Last night I slept over hers (over hers)
[00:14.09] During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
[00:16.72] A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
[00:19.96] Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa
[00:23.07] Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash
[00:25.85] Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
[00:28.86] A real ninja with the blade and the mask
[00:31.20] Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchucks
[00:35.07] Now she tryna patch me up, but
[00:37.63] Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust
[00:40.20] If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
[00:43.27] But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
[01:05.77] 
[00:46.15] The blinds wide open so he can
[00:48.82] See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
[00:51.50] Naked body, fresh out the shower
[00:54.75] You touch yourself after hours
[00:57.41] Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
[01:00.37] You're sleeping alone in your bed
[01:16.87] 
[01:03.81] But check your window, (swag) he's at your window
[01:28.31] 
[01:08.56] The night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
[01:11.48] I'm a down to earth nigga with intentions that's right
[01:14.10] You'll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight
[01:17.17] But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
[01:20.00] We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
[01:22.93] You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
[01:25.71] But I give two for us cause you're the one that I want
[01:28.51] Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy
[01:31.88] See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
[01:34.40] But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
[01:37.25] We as including I and yourself, making three
[01:40.15] Little ones drums beating pretty hard if you ask me
[01:43.85] You're a pretty broad in the top three
[01:46.15] Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
[02:08.15] 
[01:48.38] Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
[01:51.42] We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time
[01:55.32] The blinds wide open so he can
[01:57.73] See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
[02:17.73] 
[02:00.48] Naked body, fresh out the shower
[02:03.53] You touch yourself after hours

[02:56.59] 
[02:29.53] Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous

[02:34.56] And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with
[02:37.65] You... cunt
